# Hey, I'm Raúl

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Machine Learning Scientist based in Toronto, Canada, passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems—especially in healthcare and diagnostics. I thrive at the intersection of deep learning, generative AI, and MLOps.

### 🌟 About Me
- 🔭 I’m working on:
  - Advancing generative AI and RAG systems for healthcare applications
  - Building LLM-powered medical assistants like **[AgentMD](https://github.com/RaulBz/AgentMD)**
  - ML-powered diagnostics for liver disease using ultrasound signals at **[Oncoustics](https://oncoustics.com/)**
- 🌱 I’m exploring: Advanced LLMs, RAG systems, and quantum-inspired ML
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on: Medical AI, generative models, or open-source MLOps tools
- 💬 Ask me about: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Vertex AI, or anything ML in healthcare
- ⚡ Fun fact: I co-founded **[Menten AI](https://www.menten.ai)**, a start-up that uses ML to accelerate protein design
